PROJECT STEPS:

-----------------------------------------------

1) Finding data

-----------------------------------------------

I've been searching for data that would enable a comparison of an indicator for different countries and different years
and ideally at least one more category other than the main indicator.
I've found Eurostat database with great documentation and wide range of topics.
 
I've chosen the topic 'Youth unemployment'.
I'd like to analyze this topic more because I am a recent graduate and from my international experience,
I've found it fascinating what impact unemployment can have on people already during their school years,
when they are aware of possible difficulties that they would be facing in near future, when trying to find a job.

The dataset I source data from:
'Youth unemployment rate by sex, age and NUTS 2 regions'
	Time frequency: Annualy 
	Age categories: 15-19, 20-24, 25-29 years
	Sex: Total, Males, Females
	Unit of measure: Percentage
	Geopolitical entity (reporting): 
		- Aggregation: European Union - 27 countries (from 2020) 
		- Countries
		- NUTS1 regions
		- NUTS2 regions
	Time: 1999-2022

I analyze the data available on Eurostat. 
I've choosen more general categorisation (men and women together, no regions, only countries) to avoid null values.

I filter data to download only what I will use:
3 separate spreadsheets for 3 chosen age categories, men and women together, only EU countries, for all available years (1999-2022).

-----------------------------------------------

2) Transforming data

-----------------------------------------------

Data transformation in PowerQuery.
Cleaning data from unnecessary rows and columns.
I have countries in one column and then one column for each year.
	-> I want only 3 columns: country, year, value. 
	I googled and found a solution: unpivot columns.
	Therefore, I use first row (years) as headers and unpivot the year columns to display in only one column, but multiple rows.

I've discovered by accident that I cannot move the source data files, but I need to move them from downloads to the project folder.
	-> I googled and found a solution. After moving files, I changed the source in Power BI directly.

To dislay percentage value correctly, I create a new column, dividing the value column by 100. 
This column can be changed to % format and displays correctly.

All 3 tables display the same data, only for 3 different age categories.
Therefore, I merge the tables in one (on the same country and year).

Two additional tables created:
- list of countries
	(any of the 3 tables duplicated -> only the column with countries left -> eliminate duplicates,
	all of the 3 tables contain the same countries, hence no need to repeat the step for the different tables)
- list of years (similar steps).

In Model view, I connect tables with years and countries 1-* to the 3 tables with data.

Adding a hierarchy - european regions.

-----------------------------------------------

I've discovered how to download all data that I filter on Eurostat at once, with no need of too much additional formating and unpivoting.
Data downloads all at once (in csv/xlsx/tsv/gz formats). 
Additionaly, code lists are available (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bulk?lang=en&selectedTab=codeList),
this could prevent discrepancies in the future if the dataset would grow (if I'd like to merge/connect current dataset with more data).
This way, data is much cleaner and proper for data analysis use.
The dilema is if I should start the project from scratch again, now that I already have visualisations in progress:
I could either continue with the datasets that I had already transformed in a quite complicated way (not ideal),
or download datasets the preferrable way and start from zero, but have it clean and easily readable
(for example with codes of countries instead of their names, enabling use of code lists ofr more clarity).

I decide to begin from sctratch. With all I know about the data structure now, it won't take that long.

-----------------------------------------------

On Eurostat website, I download the appropriately filtered data in csv and code lists in tsv.
This way, I have less tables than previously, all data connected together (= clearer data structure). 
Data concentration in one central table will enable to create more interesting visualisations more easily.

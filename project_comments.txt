PROJECT COMMENTS

This file contains comments about the progress and steps that I've taken while creating the Power BI project, 
including my struggles and solutions that I've found.

First, I've started with the project, discarded that version afterwards and restarted the project from scratch.
However, I've learned a lot during that phase, so I include it in the below comments as well.


-----------------------------------------------

1) Finding data

-----------------------------------------------

I've been searching for data that would enable a comparison of an indicator for different countries and different years
and ideally at least one more category other than the main indicator.
I've found Eurostat database with great documentation and wide range of topics.
 
I've chosen the topic 'Youth unemployment'.
I'd like to analyse this topic more because I am a recent graduate and from my international experience,
I've seen what impact unemployment can have on people already during their school years,
when they are aware of possible difficulties that they would be facing in near future, when trying to find a job.

The dataset I've chosen: 'Youth unemployment rate by sex, age and NUTS 2 regions' (Eurostat - https://doi.org/10.2908/YTH_EMPL_110)
	Time frequency: Annually
	Age categories: 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 15-29 years
	Sex: Total, Males, Females
	Unit of measure: Percentage
	Geopolitical entity (reporting):
		- Countries
	Time: 1999-2022

-----------------------------------------------

FIRST VERSION - discarded later

-----------------------------------------------

I've filtered data to download only what I would use:
3 separate spreadsheets for 3 chosen age categories, men and women together, only EU countries, for all available years (1999-2022).

-----------------------------------------------

2) Transforming data

-----------------------------------------------

Data transformation in Power Query.
Cleaning data from unnecessary rows and columns.
I have countries in one column and then one column for each year.
	-> I want only 3 columns: country, year, value. 
	I googled and found a solution: unpivot columns.
	Therefore, I use first row (years) as headers and unpivot the year columns to display in only one column, but multiple rows.

I've discovered by accident that I cannot move the source data files, but I needed to move them from downloads to the project folder.
	-> I googled and found a solution. After moving files, I changed the source in Power BI directly.

To display percentage value correctly, I create a new column, dividing the value column by 100. 
This column can be changed to % format and displays correctly. 
Later, I've found a more convenient solution (below).

All 3 tables display the same data, only for 3 different age categories.
Therefore, I merge the tables in one (on the same country and year).

Two additional tables created:
- list of countries
	(any of the 3 tables duplicated -> only the column with countries left -> eliminate duplicates,
	all the 3 tables contain the same countries, hence no need to repeat the step for the different tables)
- list of years (similar steps).

In Model view, I connect tables containing unique years and countries 1-* to the 3 tables with data.

Adding a hierarchy - European regions.

-----------------------------------------------

DISCARTING FIRST VERSION
RESTARTING PROJECT FROM SCRATCH

-----------------------------------------------

I've discovered how to download all data that I filter on Eurostat at once, with no need of too much additional formatting and unpivoting.
Data downloads all at once (in csv/xlsx/tsv/gz formats).

Additionally, code lists are available (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bulk?lang=en&selectedTab=codeList).
This could prevent discrepancies in the future if the dataset would grow (if I'd like to merge/connect current dataset with more data).

This way, data is much cleaner and appropriate for data analysis use.

The dilemma is if I should start the project from scratch again, now that I already have visualisations in progress:
I could either continue with the datasets that I had already transformed in a quite complicated way (not ideal),
or download datasets the preferrable way and start from zero, but have it clean and easily readable
(for example, with codes of countries instead of their names, enabling use of code lists for more clarity).

I decide to begin from scratch. With all I know about the data structure now, it won't take that long.

-----------------------------------------------

SECOND (FINAL) VERSION

-----------------------------------------------

2) Transforming data

-----------------------------------------------

On Eurostat website, I download the appropriately filtered data in csv format and code lists in tsv format.
This way, I have less tables than previously, all data connected together (= clearer data structure), concentrated in one central table.
This will enable to create more interesting visualizations more easily.

I leave the files in csv and tsv format and transform them in Power BI directly.

Clearing data in Power Query:
	I delete unnecessary columns, adjust data types, rename columns etc.
	I merge both code lists with the main table (inner merge) to contain only data that I'll use -> reducing stored data.
	I create one more code list manually because it contains only very simple, little data (sex codes F, M, T meaning).
	One more table created for years in case I'd like to add more tables containing years.
		-> I duplicate the main table, delete all columns except the one with years and eliminate duplicates.

Need to change data type in column with values from Text to Decimals, but it doesn't seem to work: 
Decimals are shown with a comma as a delimiter and values don't display in Data view at all.
	-> Resolved:
		Commas are correct as a delimiter for decimals. 
		In Data view, null values were displaying at the top, hence no values were visible unless scrolling down.

Transforming values: divide by 100 (percent). 
	By googling, I've found a direct option: From Number -> Standard -> Percentage.

Connections created between tables in Model view.

-----------------------------------------------

3) Visualizing data

-----------------------------------------------

Inspiration for colours/design choice found on Google.

First, I roughly determine what I want to visualize:
	- contrast men x women
	- contrast different countries
	- contrast different years 
	- contrast different age groups

How I can visualize it:
	- clustered bar/column charts (men x women or age groups comparison)
	- map (countries comparison)
	- line chart (development over years)
	- cards (most important values overview)
	- slicers (to filter what is displayed)

I won't probably use any stacked visualisations or pie charts because I only work with data about chosen age groups, not the whole population.

Visualizations and intro page created.
Added navigation buttons on each page.
Created bookmarks (to display only V4 countries in 2002, 2012, 2022).

Final touch:
Went through the report as a whole.
	- Smoothed the design to be matching between different pages.
	- Corrected the default naming where needed.
	- Tested functionalities, slicers, buttons. Adjusted if something didn't work properly.
